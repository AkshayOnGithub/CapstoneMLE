# 🐱‍👤 AAJK Team Project

This is a temporary workspace for us to share code and processes.

## Objective

Taken from our  cohorts "Structured Learning Recommendations" [0] as it does encompass all the work. Specific details linked in the [resources](#resources) section below.

* Learn data and modeling tools in Python [1]
* Set up your software development environment [2]
* Learn version control, building APIs, and containers [3]
* Choose a business problem to solve [4]
  * Find a pre-existing dataset and/or pre-trained model
  * Deploy your first web application (locally)
  * Containerize the application and deploy to the cloud
  * Define ML metrics to monitor 
  * Find users to try out your solution and get feedback from
  * Iterate on your choice of data and model based on feedback and metrics
  * Build out a GitHub with README.md describing your project
  * Create a YouTube video demonstration and presentation

## Development

We have a board setup to track deliverables, and to keep the project on track - timewise.

## Workflow

TBD (e.g. Define feature story on Team board > Develop feature > Create issue from broken feature)

## Calendar

The project's weekly deliverables [5][6] have been added as milestones by due date.
