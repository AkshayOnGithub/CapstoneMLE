      "QA(question='Will Red Hat provide formal technical support for The Fedora Project?', answer=\"No, no formal Web or phone support for The Fedora Project will be available from Red Hat. Red Hat's supported product line will be based in part on a recent release of Fedora, and our development will be done externally as part of The Fedora Project as much as possible.\")\n",
      "QA(question='Why should I help?', answer=\"Your name in lights, an online CV, and maybe a trip to a FUDCon.. First, contribute to Fedora and you may get your name in the distribution.  Hey, fair is fair.. Second, if you're a Fedora contributor, you don't need a fancy resume; you can just tell potential employers to 'Google' your name.. Third, top Fedora contributors can receive travel stipends to attend the Fedora Users and Developers Conference nearest them.  You will have the opportunity to meet some of the giants of the open source movement in person, as their peers and equals.. And last, you'd be playing with this stuff anyway.  Spend your time doing stuff that you will enjoy and that others will use.  What more incentive do you need?  Join us.\")\n",
      "QA(question='What is the errata or updates policy for The Fedora Project?', answer=\"Security updates, bugfix updates, and new feature updates will all be available, through Red Hat and third parties. Updates may be staged (first made available for public qualification, then later for general consumption) when appropriate. In drastic cases, we may remove a package from The Fedora Project if we judge that a necessary security update is too problematic/disruptive to the larger goals of the project. Availability of updates should not be misconstrued as support for anything other than continued development and innovation of the code base. Some updates that are too disruptive to include in a general release will be made available only in the development branch and included in the subsequent general release. Merely continuing to update won't lead to a next release and you need to explicitly do a distribution upgrade if desired. Updates are available for every release for the period denoted in the LifeCycle page.. Red Hat will not be providing an SLA (Service Level Agreement) for resolution times for updates for The Fedora Project. Security updates will take priority. For packages maintained by external parties, Red Hat may respond to security holes by deprecating packages if the external maintainers do not provide updates in a reasonable time. Users who want support, or maintenance according to an SLA, may purchase the appropriate Red Hat Enterprise Linux product for their use.\")\n",
      "QA(question='What is SELinux, and where can I read more about it?', answer=\"Fedora is the first mainstream operating system in the world to provide a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security system by default, using the SELinux framework.  The SELinux configuration included in Fedora provides enhanced security by restricting the actions of processes running on a Fedora system. Being restricted to certain privileges/actions drastically reduces the impact of security vulnerabilities. These programs, processes or services are fenced-in with no access allowed outside their registered rights.. SELinux in Fedora, also has a 'strict' policy, which is useful for very security-sensitive environments. There are other security ssub-systems enabled through the SELinux framework, such as MLS, MCS and RBAC.. Refer to the following document for more information on the SELinux implementation in Fedora:\")\n",
      "QA(question=\"Why doesn't Fedora include DVD video playback support?\", answer=\"The DVD video formats are covered by patents, and the patent owners have not released the technologies under licenses which are compatible with Fedora's requirements.  Many DVD videos also use a copy protection technology, and the code necessary to play those videos may violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a copyright law of the United States.. Fedora only supports and includes free and open source software.  Technologies under stringent copyright or patent restrictions are not included in Fedora.  For more information about multimedia support in Fedora, including more about DVD video support, see the Multimedia section:\")\n",

      "QA(question='What are the primary benefits of this change?', answer='Changing the product to a project:')\n",
      "QA(question='What is the difference between \"Fedora distribution\", \"The Fedora Project\", and \"Fedora\"?', answer='The Fedora Project is a collection of sub-projects.  The Fedora distribution is the central project, which aims to provide a platform with the best in free and open source software.  Fedora generally refers to the Fedora Project as a whole. Sometimes Fedora is used to refer to a collection of software from the Fedora Project or a system running Fedora software, but we prefer to refer to these with either specific names like Fedora Workstation, Fedora CoreOS, etc., or as Fedora Linux.')\n",
      "QA(question='What is Fedora?', answer='Fedora is a Linux-based operating system that showcases the latest in free and open source software. Fedora is always free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. It is built by people across the globe who work together as a community: the Fedora Project. The Fedora Project is open and anyone is welcome to join. The Fedora Project is out front for you, leading the advancement of free, open software and content.. Refer also to the Overview page.')\n",
